Bubble Sort(arr, size)
		for i=0 to n-i-1
			for j=0 to n-i-2
				if arr[j]>arr[j+1]
					Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]


Sort the input array with the above bubble sort algorithm

Initialize a dynamic array to store the largest array found

Initialize array_pointer to point to start of input_sorted_array

Get the value pointer by array_pointer and increment value 

if incremented_value matches the next location of array_pointer
keep storing the array to a local_array

if incremented_value not equal to value pointed next by array_pointer
copy the local_array to dynamic array created for the largest_array_found

Keep repeating this until the end of the input sorted array
and if the local_array is greater than largest_array_found
overwrite largest_array_found with local array

once the end of array is reached
find the lowest and the highest value in the largest_array_found
and return them as an array
