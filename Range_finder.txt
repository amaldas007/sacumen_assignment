Remove duplicates items from the array
 for i in range (1, length_of_array + 1):
    coompare element in i and i+1 indexes
    if the difference is 1
      keep storing  first and last indexes of largest array until difference becomes greater than 1
      compare the next array formed to the largest array stored until loop ends
 Return the first and last indexes of largest array after looping through the length of the array once
